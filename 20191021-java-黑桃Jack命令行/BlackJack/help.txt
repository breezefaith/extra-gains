The following are the game rules: 1. Each player starts the game with zero points. 2. Prior to each round, each player is given the following set of five tiles. 
Each tile has a value and an associated score: Tile Value{1,2,3,5,7} Score {5,4,3,2,1}. 3.No other tile value can be played other than the above primes. 
This must be validated when the user selects a tile as well. 
An error message should be displayed for an incorrect selection and the user can reselect. 4. Each player has the same set of 5 tiles. 
Each player can use each of their 5 files only ONCE in each round. 5. Before each round, the game will automatically decide 
if the human player goes first or the computer player goes first. 6. For each round, each player will play ONE tile, with the tile value adding to the game total for that round. 
Provided the game total is less than or equal to 21, the player will get the score for using that tile. 
However, if the game total is greater than 21, no score is allocated 
to the player who played the last tile causing the score to become greater than 21. 
As per the following example: Round 1 both players have 5 tiles each {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}, {1, 2, 3, 5 ,7} 
Human player plays tile 3. 
Game Total is now 3. 
Human player score is 3. 
Computer player plays tile 1. 
Game Total is now 4. 
Computer player score is 5. Round 2 both players have 4 tiles each {1, 2, 5, 7}, {2, 3, 5 ,7} 
Human player plays tile 5. 
Game Total is now 9. 
Human player score is 5. 
Computer player plays tile 7. 
Game Total is now 16. 
Computer player score is 6.Round 3 both players have 3 tiles each {1, 2, 7}, {2, 3, 5} 
Human player plays tile 1. 
Game Total is now 17. 
Human player score is 10. 
Computer player plays tile 2. 
Game Total is now 19. 
Computer player score is 10. Round 4 both players have 2 tiles each {2, 7}, {3, 5} 
Human player plays tile 2. 
Game Total is now 21.
Human player score is 14. Round Over Final Score 
Human Player is 14 + 5 - 0 = 19 
Computer Player is 10 + 0 - 3 = 7 
(Since computer player did not use the tile with value 5) 7. Once the round ends, the following are the rules for scoring: o Each player will get their score based on the total of the tiles they have used during
the round. o Any player who has NOT used the tile with the value of 5, 
will get a penalty of -3 points. o The player who, after all deductions, has the highest score, 
will be the winner of that round and will get 5 points. 8. At the end of all the rounds, the player 
who has won the most rounds is declared the winner of the game.
