Lab 12

due: 11/15/19

 

1. Write and implement the following two methods:

 

      String addL(String n1, String n2) – returns n1+n2.

      String mulL(String n1, String n2) – returns n1*n2.

 

Note that n1 and n2 are very long integer strings. Therefore, converting n1 and n2 into int or long type 
is not allowed because of possible overflow error.

 

*.length() and .charAt() are the only built-in methods allowed in this assignment. (Using some built-in 
classes like java.math.BigInteger is absolutely not allowed.)

* Use the following menu in the main:

 

      a: add

   m: multiply

   q: Quit
